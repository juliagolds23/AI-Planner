This project is a web app that harnesses Open AI's API to help users plan and organize their tasks. After downloading this zip file, open it in your codespace and run flask. When you open the local host, you'll  be prompted to login or register. When you register you'll need to set a username and password. 

The home page is your personal planner. In the main textbox, describe your tasks in as much detail as you can. This is meant to be a "brain dump" of sorts - feel free to give it any paramaters as well (like when you want to wake up, what your top priority is, etc). Tasks will automatically be scheduled for today, but you can adjust this via the buttons at the top. After writing your prompt, you'll click "generate schedule." In a few seconds, Open AI will return an optimal schedule for your day, by parsing out each task in your prompt. These tasks will then also be fed to both your task list ("My Tasks", and your "Week View" - both accessible via the navigation bar at the top).

If you're unhappy with your schedule, simply generating a new one for that same day will clear both your calendar and the tasks that were added to your to-do list. If you want to add tasks to your to-do list without scheduling them, you're able to do so using the full tasks table. Any other information added here will not be added to the schedule - it's just for you to see. 


Please reach out if you have any issues with your scheduler or the AI software.
